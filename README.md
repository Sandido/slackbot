# Rewrite:
Need to update this as the bot has been migrated to an Azure web app!

# slackbot
for making a slack bot that translates languages


## Run venv
testenv\Scripts\activate

## Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt

ngrok needs to be running via 
'ngrok http ####'
'####' being whatever port you have the app running on in the app code. 

## run
run the bot.py file, then go to the slack workspace and use the /translate cmd.
